# Vehicle Synergy Rules
## Inter-Vehicle Interactions and Specialized Convoy Capabilities

### Introduction

This document details how specialized vehicles can enhance convoy-wide performance through synergistic interactions. These rules transform convoys from collections of individual vehicles into integrated systems with emergent capabilities that exceed the sum of their parts.

## Synergy System Quick Reference

Vehicle synergies create convoy-wide bonuses through specialized interactions:

- **Production Chains:** Vehicles that create resources for other vehicles to use
- **Support Networks:** Vehicles that enhance the capabilities of other convoy members
- **Operational Synergies:** Vehicles that improve convoy-wide efficiency and performance
- **Defensive Formations:** Vehicles that provide protection and tactical advantages
- **Logistics Integration:** Vehicles that optimize resource management and supply chains

## Core Synergy Mechanics

### Synergy Categories

#### Primary Synergies
**Definition:** Direct statistical bonuses that one vehicle provides to the entire convoy
**Examples:** Scout vehicle reducing fuel consumption, workshop reducing maintenance costs
**Calculation:** Apply modifier to relevant convoy statistic

#### Secondary Synergies  
**Definition:** Conditional bonuses that require multiple specific vehicles
**Examples:** Bio-diesel processor + agricultural vehicle, multiple combat vehicles
**Calculation:** Enhanced bonuses when prerequisites are met

#### Scaling Synergies
**Definition:** Benefits that increase with convoy size or vehicle combinations
**Examples:** Communication network efficiency, redundant system bonuses
**Calculation:** Bonus scales with number of participating vehicles

### Synergy Stacking Rules

#### Multiplicative Stacking
Most synergies stack multiplicatively to prevent overpowered combinations:
**Example:** Scout bonus (×0.95) + Workshop bonus (×0.85) = ×0.8075 total modifier

#### Additive Bonuses
Some synergies provide flat bonuses that add together:
**Example:** Multiple combat vehicles each provide +1 convoy defense rating

#### Diminishing Returns
Large synergy networks have reduced effectiveness:
**Example:** 4th+ support vehicle provides only 50% of normal bonus

## Synergy Design Guidelines

### Creating Custom Synergies

#### Step 1: Identify Vehicle Specializations
- What unique capability does each vehicle provide?
- How could this capability benefit other convoy members?
- What resources or conditions are required?

#### Step 2: Define Interaction Mechanisms
- Direct statistical bonuses (fuel, speed, maneuverability)
- New capabilities (construction, medical, communication)
- Resource generation (fuel, food, parts, trade goods)

#### Step 3: Balance Benefits and Costs
- Synergy strength should match vehicle investment
- Multiple vehicle requirements for powerful bonuses
- Clear trade-offs in convoy composition

#### Step 4: Test Synergy Chains
- How do multiple synergies interact?
- Are there overpowered combinations?
- Do synergies create interesting tactical choices?

### Synergy Balance Principles

#### Meaningful Investment
**Principle:** Synergies require meaningful vehicle slots and resources
**Implementation:** Specialized vehicles have reduced cargo/speed/efficiency
**Result:** Players must choose between synergy power and convoy simplicity

#### Diminishing Returns
**Principle:** Additional synergies become less effective
**Implementation:** 3rd+ synergy vehicles provide reduced bonuses
**Result:** Prevents synergy stacking from becoming overpowered

#### Vulnerability Creation
**Principle:** Specialized vehicles create new failure points
**Implementation:** Destroying key synergy vehicle breaks entire chain
**Result:** Risk/reward balance for powerful synergy networks
